Hi, Iâ€™m Quentin ðŸ‘‹ 
  I am a fullstack Software developer who loves a challenge and am eager to learn.

  Recently I have been learning aws, docker and nginx for deployment. I was successful in dockerizing my apps and getting them deployed to my aws, I also used Certbot for my certificates.
  
  Coding and tech have been my passion since I got my first windows system which was a 200mhz packard bell as a kid and the life long experience of having a pc at my side for my entire life has given me the ability to quickly learn and adapt with new tech/software fast and efficiently.
  
Thank you for taking the time to read this and please shoot me an email if you are looking to collaborate or hire a skilled developer.
