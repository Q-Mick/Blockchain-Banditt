Hi, Iâ€™m Quentin ðŸ‘‹ 
  I am a fullstack Software developer who loves a challenge and am eager to learn.

  Recently I have been learning aws, docker and nginx for deployment. I was successful in dockerizing my apps(after a week of banging my head), both back and front and getting them deployed to my aws, keepr backend is a .NET container thats also serving my front end using nginx with certbot ssl certificates as a reverse proxy.
  
  Coding and tech have been my passion since I got my first windows system which was a 200mhz packard bell as a kid and having a pc at my side for my entire life has given me the ability to quickly learn and adapt with new tech/software fast and efficiently.
