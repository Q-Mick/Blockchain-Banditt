Hi, Iâ€™m Quentin ðŸ‘‹ 
  I am a fullstack Software developer who loves a challenge and am eager to learn.

 AWS - C# .NET DAPPER - JS/TS - React/VUE
  
  Coding and tech have been my passion since I got my first windows system which was a 200mhz packard bell as a kid and having a pc at my side for nearly my entire life has given me the ability to quickly learn and adapt with new tech/software fast and efficiently.
