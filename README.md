Hi, Iâ€™m Quentin ðŸ‘‹ 
  I am a fullstack Software developer who loves to dive in to the code and face challenges head on. In my life experience one of the best ways for me to learn and retain knowledge/skills has been to analyze and critical think about these problems. Nothing excites me more than to reasearch, find resources and piece together bits of knowledge to come up with a solution. This is one of the reasons I love coding, there is a never ending list of technical problems/features to deal with and an unlimited amount of things to learn. If it's coming up with a solution to a an issue as a team or just solo learning a new tech stack the feeling of reward is what I love. Coding and tech have been my passion since I got my first windows system which was a 200mhz packard bell as a kid and the life long experience of having a pc at my side for my entire life has given me the ability to quickly learn and adapt with new tech/software fast and efficiently.
  Thank you for taking the time to read this and please shoot me an email if you are looking to collaborate or hire a skilled developer.
